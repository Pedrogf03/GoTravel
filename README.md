# GoTravel
### THIS IS JUST A FINAL PROJECT FOR ONE OF THE COURSES I TOOK. ALL PAYMENTS AND SENSITIVE FEATURES ARE FAKE, MADE IN SANDBOX MODE.
GoTravel is a Desktop & Mobile App for booking services offered by other users.

You can register for free as a regular user, allowing you to search for and book services, chat with professionals offering services, organize your travels as you wish, and more.

With a monthly subscription, you can become a professional and offer your services to other users. For instance, you might drive your own car and offer rides, rent out an empty apartment, or even provide guided tours and similar services.

To make it work, you need to run the server on your computer. Then, in both the Desktop and Mobile App, you must enter the IP address of the computer where the server is installed. Once completed, you can connect to your server and log in to GoTravel.
